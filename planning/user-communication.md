## 🎯 **TARGETED COMMUNICATIONS**

### **For Angry Users**

We completely understand your frustration with v1.5.0. A critical error made the extension completely unusable, and that's unacceptable.

We value your feedback and are working hard to regain your trust.
```

### **For Technical Users**
```markdown
**Technical Details:**

- **Prevention**: Added runtime verification and automated testing

**Code Change:**
```typescript
// Before (broken)
import { ErrorRecovery } from './errorRecovery';

// After (fixed)
import { AdvancedErrorRecovery } from './errorRecovery';
```

Full technical analysis available in our GitHub repository.
